    description: |
      All nodes in a parsed XML document are represented by an instance of one
      of the following classes. Each class inherits from the base `XmlNode`
      class, which provides common functionality that's available on every node.

      While the use of classes to represent XML nodes may seem a little
      old-school, it has many benefits. It allows static analysis, provides
      better type safety, and also offers some performance benefits over using
      plain objects, since JS engines are better able to optimize class
      instances in some cases.

      If you'd prefer to work with plain objects, you can easily convert any
      node (including an entire document) to a plain object tree by calling its
      `toJSON()` method:

      ```js
      let plainDoc = parseXml(xml).toJSON();
      ```

      In addition, any node (including the document) can safely be serialized to
      a JSON string without any special steps simply by passing it to
      `JSON.stringify()`. So converting an XML document to JSON is as easy as:

      ```js
      let json = JSON.stringify(parseXml(xml));
      ```
